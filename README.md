Hello Crumbs is a web application which comes handy in many ways, ranging from avoiding food waste to saving time and money, and possibly leading to the discovery of new recipe.

Hello Crumbs is an interactive app that takes input - list of ingredients - from a user and returns an array of recipes which match the ingredients the user submits. The user can also customize the search by applying filters such as cuisine, type of meal, or select to exclude certain ingredients. 

The technologies used in app development: ``React.js, NPM, Material UI, BootStrap, CSS, API``.

The app has been deployed on ``Netlify`` platform.

## User Story
```
AS a person that wants to prepare a dish​

I WANT to easily find a recipe that matches the ingredients I already have at home​

SO THAT I don't waste time and energy searching through recipes that don't include the ingredients I have at my disposal​
```
## Functionality

On visit to the Hello Crumbs landing page, the user is greated by a welcome message and an information (about the app). There is a step-by-step instruction for the user on how the app works. At the bottom of the Home Page the user find the 'Get Started' button which navigates them to the Search Page.

Search can be made based on the following categories - Ingredient selection (minimum 3), cuisine, meal type and diet definition. Search can also be made based on food intolerances and cooking duration... 

The search bars are drop-down input field-type that provide suggestions as the user enters the ingredients. The search recipe takes a minimum of 3 ingredients to return a list of recipes.

When the user clicks on a recipe, the recipe and its information is presented to the user.
